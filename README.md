# Simple Liker

## Introduction
Welcome to Simple Liker! This is a simple social media application where you can like and unlike posts by clicking on a heart icon. This project is designed to help you understand the three essential pillars of front-end web programming: manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), recognizing JavaScript events, and communicating with the server.

## Getting Started
To get started with Simple Liker, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
Once you have the application open in your browser, you'll see several posts displayed on the page. Each post has a "Like" button and a heart icon. To like a post, simply click on the heart icon. The heart icon will change color to indicate that you've liked the post.

## Structure of the Application
The application consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `demo.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles DOM manipulation, event listening, and server communication.
- `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the application.

## Functionality
- **Step 1: Locating Heart Elements**: Uncomment code in `demo.js` to locate the heart elements in the DOM.
- **Step 2: Setting up Mock Server Communication**: Uncomment code in `demo.js` to set up mock server communication.
- **Step 3: Listening for Click Events**: Uncomment code in `demo.js` to listen for click events on like buttons and update the DOM accordingly.

## Testing
This project includes basic functionality tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected. You can run the tests by opening the `index.html` file in your browser and checking that you can like and unlike posts successfully.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully set up and interacted with Simple Liker, a basic social media application. This project serves as a starting point for understanding front-end web programming concepts and the interaction between the three essential pillars of web development.
